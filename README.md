# RustComputerScienceExamples
Computer science concepts implemented in rust

Current Repository I am working on are:
- [python version](https://github.com/NativeCognitive/PyComputerScienceExamples)
- (rust version](https://github.com/NativeCognitive/RustComputerScienceExamples)
- [go version](https://github.com/NativeCognitive/GoComputerScienceExamples)

I will be updating these repositories as I learn computer science with the code representations as I learn

Currently I am using:
https://roadmap.sh/computer-science
and
https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university

I highly recommend checking those out, I am attempting to write the examples for anyone learning, including me
